# TechExperience-Line-Following-Robot
This is a project by EPFL. We are building a line following robot.

## PATHFINDERS Project Objectives
1.	Teach basic robotics and programming concepts through building a line follower robot.
2.	Foster teamwork and collaboration.
3.	Introduce GitHub for version control and collaborative coding.
4.	Develop presentation and reporting skills.

To start programming the robot kit, check the following tutorials provided by Texas Instruments to complete the line follower demo: https://www.ti.com/video/series/ti-robotics-system-learning-kit-max-ti-rslk-max-curriculum-modules.html
- [x] Module 1 - explains how to configure the environment to program the LaunchPad (the red board on top of the robot) using code composer studio (CCS). 
- [ ] Module 4 - software development with the MSP32 (the processor of the LaunchPad) - you might be interested in the debugging part.
- [ ] Module 6 - it shows how to configure GPIO pins, which will help you understand how to use the infrared (reflectance) sensor 
- [ ] Module 7 - is about finite state machines, the strategy used to program the behavior of the robot. This last tutorial gives a good summary of how the FSM for the line follower works.
- [ ] Module 10 - to learn about SysTick periodic interrupts, the idea is to generate an interrupt when you have a detection of the robot moving away from the black line. 
- [ ] Module 12 - to learn how to program the DC motors and demo to move the robot in a preset pattern
- [ ] Module 13 - will help you understand how to control the motors with Pulse With Modulation (PWM).
